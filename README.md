# Hello World

## Background

The CS@CU MS Bridge program provides an opportunity to transition from other backgrounds into a career in computer science. Class is one important part of that transition, but the world of computer science is large with self-learning also being important to sucess. This repository is created by the students of the [CS@CU MS Bridge](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/) program to help with their own self learning and to provide resources to others transitioning into computer science. 

## Hello World

One solution to encourgaing self-learning and the exploration of computer science is this GitHub repository. We title it Hello World in honor of the classic first program you make in computer science. It provides an opportunity for CS@CU MS Bridge students both in the Bridge and those who have transitioned to the full MS at Columbia an opportunity to learn about a topic, create a directory for it, and share their knowledge with and for the benefit of others. This is a not an official project of Columbia University.

## How we are encouraging exploration (self-learning) within computer science 

This repository includes different directories and corresponding `Readme` files created by CS@CU MS Bridge community of students. Each repository is made both as a learning experience for the contributors and to provide guides for future Bridge students and the general public. Below are also useful quick links for self-learning from external sources.
