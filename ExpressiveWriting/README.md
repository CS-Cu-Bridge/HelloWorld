### Why should you read this?

You should read this repository if you want to get others interested in a CS related piece of work you've done. After you've been working with a project for a while, it may be that you know how it works and more importantly, you know why it matters. That said, if you want your work to gain a wider audience and more users, you need to convey that how and why to others. This repository provides a few strategies to complete that task. 

### Why you should not read this?

You want to write a CS paper. The skills of writing expressively should aid you in writing an academic paper, but that is a different task that would need further skills ontop of what you learn here. You can treat this as a primer, but academic writing is beyond the scope of this document.
